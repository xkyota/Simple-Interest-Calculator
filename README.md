# Simple-Interest-Calculator

A simple C program that calculates the simple interest based on the principal, rate of interest, and time period.

The program prompts the user to input the following values:

- Principal (p): The initial amount of money.
- Rate (r): The rate of interest (in percentage).
- Time (t): The time period (in years).

It then calculates the simple interest using the formula:

Simple Interest = (Principal _ Rate _ Time) / 100
Finally, it prints the calculated simple interest.
